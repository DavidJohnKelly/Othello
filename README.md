# Project

This project aims to implement a two player game of Othello, including a greedy AI for decision making if requested.

# Tech

This project is built with Java 13 and uses no external libraries. The GUI is Java Swing which should already be built into your JDK.

# Controls

Simply click on a valid square when it is your turn and your piece will be placed. Alternatively, click greedy AI button to have the AI make the decision for you.

## Info

There are two windows open at the start overlapping each other. Simply move one to the side to see the other.
